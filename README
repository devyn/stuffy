[[ a thing to manage every thing ]]

Stuffy is an object manager. It can literally manage anything and everything through the use of plugins.

::: Creating a Plugin
It's easy! Just make a subclass of Stuffy::Plugin. This is a special class that contains one method: inherited. When Stuffy::Plugin gets inherited, it enters the subclass and defines all the methods.

class Stuffy::SampleFile < Stuffy::Plugin
end

Then, you need to add the plugin name, and the primary key with properties.

class Stuffy::SampleFile
    plugin_name 'sample file'
    property :location # etc.
    def primary_key; location; end # or equivalent
end

If your plugin is not something more abstract, and is just a pointer to a file with some metadata, you can add the default commands.

class Stuffy::SampleFile
    default_commands
end

Thats all a basic plugin needs. However, you will most likely want to add some of your own commands.

class Stuffy::SampleFile
    command 'read', 'reads a Sample file', '{sample-file-id}' do |id|
        sf = Stuffy::Objects.find id.to_i
        File.open(sf.location) {|f| putc f.getc until f.eof? }
    end
end
